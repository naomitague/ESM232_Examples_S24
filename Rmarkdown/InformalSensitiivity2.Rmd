# Sensitivity Analysis with *ethresh*

* Assume +-15% uncertainty in *ethresh* parameter

* Default value from the function is 10,000

* Code so that its easy to change

```{r ethresh}
# lets try sensitivity analysis again, 
# ethresh - is defaulted to 10000; lets try +- 15%
# lets try 20 samples
# assume a uniform distribution - we don't know anything about variation

# Building models with blocks - functions that call other functions


Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

* loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other - but not necessarily automatic
* fully coupled - models exchange input sna outputs (feedback systems)

Develop a conceptual model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../img/power_comparison_figure.jpeg",) 
```

# 

To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of power generated for multiple years 

* compute_profit_frompower.R

We will use output from our solarpv function as input into a function that estimates profit given a price - and also 'calls' another function to compute net present value

* compute_NPV 
    * inputs: value, time, discount rate
    
    * output  net present value of input value provide as some time in the future

* compute_profit_frompower
    
    * inputs: energy, year (energy was produced in) price, discount rate
    * outputs: single dataframe with columns for
                    * energy
                    * year
                    * net (profit from energy in that year)
                    * netpre (net present value of that profit)

```{r valuep}

source("../R/compute_NPV.R")
source("../R/compute_profit_frompower.R")

compute_profit_frompower

compute_NPV

# use solar from  site1 from above as input
head(annual_elect)

profit_solar = compute_profit_frompower(energy=annual_elect$elect,
                                        year=annual_elect$year,
                                        price=30, discount=0.04)

# Recall we also have a function that computes hydropower

 

```{r, out.width = "75%",out.height="75%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("lecture3_conceptualmodels2/assets/img/reservoir_cm.001.jpeg")
```

* Input: Reservoir height (height) and flow rate (flow)

* Output: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)

* Parameters: K Efficiency , ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

P = ρ * h * r * g * K Efficiency;

P is Power in watts, ρ is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3), h is height in meters, r is flow rate in cubic meters per second, g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, K Efficiency is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

This is a static (one point in time), deterministic, lumped (one place) model; its more or less physically based



```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#' Power Generation
#'
#' This function computes instantaneous power generation
#’ from a reservoir given its height and flow rate into turbines
#' @param rho Density of water (kg/m3) Default is 1000
#' @param g Acceleration due to gravity (m/sec2) Default is 9.8
#' @param Kefficiency Turbine Efficiency (0-1) Default is 0.8
#' @param height height of water in reservoir (m)
#' @param flow flow rate (m3/sec)
#' @author Naomi
#' @examples power_gen(20, 1)
#' @return Power generation (W/s)


power_gen = function(height, flow, rho=1000, g=9.8, Keff=0.8) {

 

  # calculate power
    result = rho * height * (flow) * g * Keff


  return(result)
}
```


see how function works

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
power_gen = function(height, flow, rho=1000, g=9.8, Keff=0.8) {

result = rho * height * flow * g * Keff
return(result)
}

power_gen(height=10, flow=2)
power_gen(10,2)
power_gen(10,2, g=4.2)

# generate some test data
measured_height=runif(min=1, max=100, n=20)

# create a data frame to store results of model run
power_estimate = cbind.data.frame(height=measured_height, estimate=power_gen(height=measured_height, flow=2))

# graph
ggplot(power_estimate,aes(height, estimate) )+geom_point()+labs(y="power in W/x", x="height (m)")
```

# Putting it all together

now lets add both of our functions (hydro and solar power), together with computing profit and sensitivity analysis to create a full picture of power options


Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as **compute_profit_frompower** for both sources of power
(such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete model

```{r reuse}

# rerun 'sampling' in using_data_with_functions.Rmd. above to get results from our reserovir model

# lets start with hydro power
source("../R/power_gen.R")

# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year 
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_years = length(profit_solar$year)

reservoir_model_res= as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=number_years, ncol=3))

colnames(reservoir_model_res)=c("height","flow","power")

# Step 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height = rnorm(mean=10, sd=1, n=number_years)

reservoir_model_res$flow = runif(min=0.1, max=1, n=number_years)

# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that 
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
Keff = runif(min=0.4, max=0.7, n=20)

# Step 3 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
reservoir = Keff %>% map_dfc(~power_gen(
  height=reservoir_model_res$height, 
  flow=reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff=.x) )

colnames(reservoir)=Keff

head(reservoir)

# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
reservoir$year = profit_solar$year

# reorganize for easier analysis 
reservoirg=as.data.frame(reservoir) %>% pivot_longer(!year,names_to="Keff", values_to="power")
head(reservoirg)

# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro = compute_profit_frompower(energy=reservoirg$power, year= reservoirg$year, price=30, discount=0.04)

names(profit_hydro)

# plot
